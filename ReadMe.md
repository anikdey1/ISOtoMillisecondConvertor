# ISOtoMillisecondConvertor
A simple Python script that converts timestamps from ISO to millisecond format.


## Motivation

I used this to learn how to [convert](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60442518/python-3-convert-iso-8601-to-milliseconds/60443033#60443033) timestamps from ISO to millisecond format. I also used this to understand the basics of [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) and a basic [rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_wlZ9IhbTs) of Python script-writing convention.
